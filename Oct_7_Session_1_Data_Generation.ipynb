    "**Objectives**: Learn how to use the time-domain simulation tools to generate a simple LDC-like dataset containing realistic instrumental noise and one MBHB signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of this session we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the instrument simulator `LISA Instrument`, run a first simulation with default configuration and plot beatnote measurements.\n",
    "3. Install the TDI package `PyTDI`, compute $X,Y,Z$ from beatnote measurements and plot $X,Y,Z$ in the time and frequency domains.\n",
    "5. Compute the PSD using the Welch method, and discuss spectral estimation subtelties such as windowing, filtering, leakage.\n",
    "6. Install the orbit simulator `LISA Orbits`, generate analytical equal-arm orbits, and plot the light travel times (LTTs).\n",
    "7. Go back to `LISA Instrument`, set up a simulation with only laser, TM and OMS noise, and equal armelength orbits.\n",
    "8. Install the `LDC` package and generate MBHB time-domain strain.\n",
    "9. Install `LISA GW Response`, compute the link response.\n",
    "10. Pass the resulting GW file to `LISA Instrument` to run a noise and signal instrument simulation, then evaluate TDI combinations via `PyTDI`.\n",
    "10. Check the data against the noise model.\n",
